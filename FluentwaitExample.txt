Selenese is the set of selenium commands which are used to test your web application.

Actions:
--------
Commands which change the state of the application are classified as actions, like click on some link, select some options on the page, select a value from drop down etc. When action is performed on page the test will fail if the action is not successful. Most common action action commands of selenium are:
    a. ClickAndWait
    b. Click

Accessors
----------
These commands check the state of the application and stores the application state in some variable. Some examples of accessors are as follows.a. storeTitle

    Examples:
    a. storeTextPresent: If text is found on the page then it stores     the boolean value as true else store false.

Assertions:
-----------
Assertions are used like the checkpoints or verification points in automation. Assertion verifies the state of the application conforms to the expected state.Example:a. verifyText
    b. verifyTitle
    c. assertText
